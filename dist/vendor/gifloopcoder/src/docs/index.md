# GIF Loop Coder (GLC) Documentation

This is the documentation for glc. I suggest you start by reading the [intro section](intro.html). Follow along with that and actually type and run the examples there. Then scan through the [Objects](objects.html), [Styles](styles.html) and [Property Types](properties.html) sections and try out different objects and styles. Once you get the hang of the program, check the [Tips and Advance Use](tips.html) section to take it to the next level.

You can also check out the [GLC Blog](http://www.gifloopcoder.com/blog), where new features, sample code and small tutorials are posted from time to time.
